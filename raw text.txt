more information, see the Which Design page.
The Unlimbited Phoenix design is the easiest version to print
and assemble. It includes a more comfortable reverse dovetail
thermo-formed gauntlet, and a cleaned palm devoid of holes
which uses a thermo-formable mesh. The palm mesh is
integrated directly into the palm, unlike the previous versions
that require 13 screws to attach.
This design takes advantage of the Thingiverse Customizer,
making it very easy to get the parts for printing in the desired
scale. Just choose left or right and set the slider in the
Customizer to the desired scale percentage, and you’ll receive
a ZIP file containing all of the parts needed at the correct scale.

Device Description The MotoGripper is a Gripper Thumb hand with a motor.
Whereas the original Gripper Thumb Hand presumed that a
non-amputated hand would be used to place an object into the
Gripper Thumb's grasp, the MotoGripper allows for
one-handed operation, opening and then closing the device
automatically each time a button is actuated. This will be
especially useful for bilateral amputees.
The MotoGripper uses "paper clip origami" in place of wires,
soldering equipment, microswitches, and microcontrollers.
Assembly should take less than an hour, and the only tools
required are needle-nosed pliers, wire cutters, and a
screwdriver. The "paper clip circuitry" is easy enough for a
child to assemble, and complex enough for a beginner's lesson
in electricity and circuit logic

high-precision, strong joints. It also supports Delrin or PTFE
tubing bearings inside the pins for smooth joints, and Igus

Device Description The team behind the original Raptor has released the Raptor
Reloaded, an updated and re-factored version of the Raptor
Hand. The entire device was modeled in Fusion 360, a free
CAD tool that can import and export most standard solid body
modeling formats such as STEP and IGES. By designing the
hand in a tool compatible with numerous CAD packages, we
hope to lower the barrier to contribution to the e-NABLE project
for engineers and designers. Previously, if a designer wanted
to make a small adjustment to a part of a hand, they’d have to
rebuild the entire part in their CAD software before they could
make the change. Now they can download the source files and
just spend their time making the specific change they had in
mind. With this new set of source files, we hope to improve the
pace of research and development within the design
community.

Details Construction of this prosthetic appears complicated at first,
however we provide a step-by-step guide, and anyone with
basic electronics and 3D printing experience can make this
themselves. The estimated fabrication time from start to finish
is approximately 80 hours. If you are creating a custom fit
insert, add another 10 hours; this will be longer if you are
unfamiliar with Fusion 360. This estimate includes file
preparation, sourcing parts, soldering circuitry, calibrating the
EMG sensors with the patient and assembly. This time may be
longer if you need to alter this prosthetic for a particular patient
or if the prosthetic does not fit in the first attempt (this can
happen).

It became apparent in our previous feasibility study that for the
3D printed prosthetics to survive the tropics, we need to
remove components that are not well-adapted to hot weather.
We therefore set out to replace all the rubber bands in the
Phoenix hand. Palm: We used the One-Arm palm designed by
below_cho as out starting point. All the cable tunnels have
been widened, the knuckle stumps removed, and a bar is
added at the thumb base for tying elastic cord.

Versatile Elbow Operated Gripper (VEOG) The VEOG
(Pronounced: Vee-O-Gee) is a digression from the
existing limb designs in that it does not attempt to look
like a normal hand. The rationale for the VEOG is that a
limb that can provide the user with some added control
over the gripping of items and still be produced on the
smaller 3D printer. The intention is for the VEOG to be a
supplement to the currently available elbow operated
devices.

Device Description The Gripper Thumb TD is an experimental
terminal device for upper limb amputees that looks
like a passive cosmetic prosthesis, but it performs
two-handed tasks without a Bowden cable.. Since
the 3D printed device is still experimental, it
should not be used without the clinical supervision
of a Certified Prosthetist or Occupational
Therapist. Special care should be taken in
selecting the printing materials to assure that
there are no layer adhesion issues or other
durability concerns.

Details Compared to the Phoenix hand, the pivot angle of the
thumb has been changed to improve the grip (based
upon 1st recipient preference), the length of the
proximal section has been increased by 5mm and the
width of the distal section increased to securely retain a
size 1 rubber 'thimblette'.
Fusion 360 CAD files are provided which will be
necessary to customize the design for particular users,
or the designer will provide customized STLs on
request. There are 3 variable parameters in the CAD
model (index finger diameters and joint length) but
adjustments to the palm piece may also be necessary
to fit the recipient.

Device Description This is a prosthetic thumb designed and supplied for a
recipient request. It is intended for someone missing a
complete thumb from either hand but having at least
proximal and middle sections of the index finger. The
thumb itself is from a Phoenix hand (120%), but in this
case is operated by movement of the user’s index
finger, assisted if necessary by the middle finger. The
design could be modified for operation using other
fingers.
To adjust the grip for objects of different sizes and
shapes, the position of the thumb, relative to the fingers
and palm, can be changed between 3 indexed positions
by changing the angle between the 2 joint pivots of the
thumb proximal section.

Device Description The Frog Arm is an experimental device for
people who have some degree of paralysis distal
to the elbow. Extending the elbow opens the
fingers. This device does nothing to close the
fingers, but many hands in paralysis are closed at
rest, so they should close again on their own
when the user bends the elbow.

Details This brace plate anchors the drive-line for the NIOP
Kwawu Remix and Shelbow modules from the NIOP
modular arm system. It is recommended that you print
the brace plate in PETG, although PLA works.
The example shown in the photos was not tied with a
knot yet so the recipient could do a final adjustment
when they received it. The small gold pin shown in the
pictures was just to secure the drive line during
shipping. The drive line should be tied securely to the
hole at the end of the plate. You can add a drop of
super glue to the knot for extra reinforcement.
A strip of 2" wide nylon webbing was used as a backing
to keep the neoprene brace from tearing under the
pressure. The brace plate can be fused to the Nylon
webbing with Locktite plastic bonder in addition to the
stitching to ensure the plate is responsive when pulled.

Details The Helix Cuff is adjustable, so it can be worn shortly
after surgery (2-3 weeks), once the incision has healed.
This gives post-op amputees an option for a prosthetic
while their stump shrinks to be fitted for a professional
socket. The cuff tension can also be adjusted with the
screw tensioner on the side.
Once the tension is set, the latch not only allows the
wearer to take the device on and off easily, but it can
also be operated with a device hand or hook, for
bilateral recipients.

Device Description This cuff is part of the NIOP prosthetic modular arm
catalog, and is used to fit transhumeral (above-elbow)
amputees and people with limb difference. The (4)
screw holes around the base of the perimeter align with
the screw pattern on the Top Plate part from the NIOP
Shelbow module
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3639811
It is very effective, so it holds on without much
constricting pressure, and the vertical supports allow
the blood to still circulate. It also is well ventilated
compared to fitted sockets. The socket is removable so
it's easy to clean, and can be thermoformed again to
adjust the fit as their stump shrinks.
The helix shape of the lacing constricts and compacts
the arm in two directions, to grip it very securely, without
slipping. If desired for extra grip, Dysem non-slip
material can be added inside the cuff to eliminate the
device from slipping, even when wet or sweaty.
